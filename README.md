Whether you're an experienced DApp developer or a curious learner just getting started with decentralized web concepts, there are plenty of ways for you to pitch in.

We open sourced the repo so for the academy contributors its easier to report issue and propose content.this is where you can read more about reporting a bug by creating a [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue/). We welcome and will incentivize this as well as submission of content proposals.

Most of our work and communication uses GitHub, a collaborative tool for code-based projects. However, you don't need coding skills to contribute to the OceanAcademy community!
