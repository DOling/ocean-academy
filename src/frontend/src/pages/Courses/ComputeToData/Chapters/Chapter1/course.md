# Chapter 1: Challenges of Collaborating with Data?

<dialog character="turtle">“For some of the deep-sea creatures, there could be only a few dozen potential mates for hundreds of miles around. In the complete void of the deep ocean, how can these rare creatures find each other in order to breed? The most extreme depths of the ocean remain mysterious and largely uncharted, but there are thousands of sea creatures down in the darkness that have found <a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/animals/how-do-rare-sea-creatures-find-each-other-to-breed.html">creative and exceptional ways to thrive</a>” ... For data, it is via Ocean Protocol.</dialog>


**Organizations have a lot of data, but they don’t use this asset effectively,  if at all. **

Organizations have come a long way to professionalize their data-related activities. Whereas some have already been able to shift their operational model into being more data driven, others are still on the way, and some have yet to begin.

But turning data into a competitive advantage is not the only way to transform this asset into a revenue stream; organizations could also earn a revenue from selling access to data to external partners. This has however not been observed at scale due to restrictions or concerns over security, privacy and trust.

Until now public and private organizations lacked a convenient and secure way to share their data and collaborate with others in data-driven industries.

**The problem with data is that it is replicable.**

The problem with data is that it can be replicated. Once copied, control, and the advantages that this data can offer diminish, or vanish entirely.

[Data breaches are frequent](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html). In June 2021, 700M LinkedIN profiles were siphoned through LinkedIN and third-party APIs and released on the darknet. Yes, that probably includes your personal information, if you use LinkedIN.

Losses may involve intellectual property, confidential company information, or personal data about customers, and the legal implications of that. As a result, companies are reluctant to share data with service providers and partners, even if that means missed opportunities.

**Collaboration on data suffers organizational barriers**.

Besides the risks associated with data losses, other factors hinder the ability of organizations to share data according to studies and surveys:

* **Awareness**. There is a general [lack of awareness that it’s possible to monetize “small” data](https://www.forschung-und-lehre.de/datengetriebene-forschung-1005/) (article in German), even though “small” data is estimated to be as valuable as “big-data”.
* **Strategic focus**. Some organizations have not (yet) invested into IT and data sharing technology, or they lack the foresight to work on new data-driven business models.
* **Structures**. There are numerous examples of organizations where a specific department or country cannot get access to internal information from another department or country within the same organization; this shows how problematic the current situation is. Organizational structures are typically not set to capture new revenue opportunities from data (for example, IT may be seen as a cost-center, not a profit center), and they do not incentivize risk taking on matters that require profound change.
* **People**. It requires a lot of talent, knowledge and skills to manage data securely and effectively. Training can bridge the gap, but training programs are conditional to data being a strategic priority for the organization.

**Data marketplaces expose data.**

Over the past years, many data marketplaces and exchanges that allow for global data sharing and trade have emerged. However, privacy laws like GDPR in the EU prohibit corporations from sharing data containing personally identifiable information (PII) unless this information is anonymized. The challenge is that proper anonymization of large Data Assets (for definitions see chapter 7) is a complex and costly task.

Another challenge with many traditional data marketplaces is that data owners lose control once a Data Asset is sold and transferred to the Buyer. What if the Buyer of the data is able to de-anonymize the data in the future? That could be a serious liability! So the data remains locked.

**Privacy-preserving data exchange protocols are an improvement, but they are no panacea.**

These circumstances led to the development of privacy-preserving data sharing technology. Most privacy-preserving data technologies provide a way for  data to never leave its repository and only aggregated, and thus anonymized, answers are returned to the Buyer of the data. Data providers can sell Compute access on their Data Assets, without  selling the data itself through marketplaces. These privacy-preserving technologies are  an improvement, but they are not perfect.

A key drawback of privacy-preserving data marketplaces is their centralization. Intermediaries represent a single point of failure, which could materialize in one way or another.

* **Counterparty risks**
    * Data Owners are effectively losing control over their data.
    * Data often needs to be deposited in custodial repositories managed by the marketplace operator, compromising its privacy.
    * Marketplaces are managed by a centralized entity, a valuable target “honeypot” for attackers.
* **Costs**
    * Data needs to be pseudonymized before depositing into the repository, which is costly.
    * The intermediary will always take a share of the revenues which is increasing with the market power of the intermediary, which eventually can become a gatekeeper.
* **Lack of Transparency**
    * Opacity and information asymmetry. Only the marketplace providers have the full knowledge of what is happening in the market, not the Data Consumers, nor the Data Providers (for definitions see chapter 7). This creates an uneven business relationship where a marketplace operator has the ability to monetize user data and use it to their own benefit at the expense of their participants.

**There is finally a solution with Ocean Protocol and CtD**

Compute-to-Data allows decentralized data sharing in science or business contexts while preserving privacy and data security. It resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it.

Now, AI practitioners & data scientists can access valuable, private data that was previously unavailable, which can lead to more accurate AI models to improve research and business outcomes.
