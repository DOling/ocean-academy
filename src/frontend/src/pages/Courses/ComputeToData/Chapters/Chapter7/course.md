**Key Take Away**

Ocean Protocol’s Compute-to-Data feature helps to open up data silos through four main features that will drive the transition from a “shadow data economy” to a an open data knowledge society ([Ocean Protocol - Compute-to-Data](https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data)):

1. **Control: **Data Owners retain control of their data, since the data never leaves the premises. With the assurance that their data stays secure, a greater incentive is created to share Compute access to their private data. Data Owners can share or sell data without having to move the data, which is slow, expensive or even impossible for huge datasets. \

2. **Privacy Technology: **Compute-to-Data orchestrates remote computation and execution on data, while preserving the privacy of the data. It only gives out results / trained models. This reduces the need for anonymization or pseudo-anonymization of personally identifiable information (PII) and adds to the incentives to share data. \

3. **Compliance:** Having only one copy of the data and not moving (making a copy of it) makes it easier to comply with data protection regulations. It further reduces the risk of data spills.  \


**Terminology**

**Data Asset.** Any entity that is comprised of data. For example, a database is a Data Asset that is comprised of data records. A Data Asset may be a system or application output file, database, document, or web page. A Data Asset also includes a service that may be provided to access data from an application. For example, a service that returns individual records from a database would be a Data Asset. Similarly, a web site that returns data in response to specific queries (e.g., www.weather.com) would be a Data Asset.

**Data Owner**. An individual or organization that legally owns one or more Data Assets.

**Data Provider / Data Seller**. An individual or organization in legitimate control of data, that shares this data under specific conditions. It may or may not be the legal owner of the data (e.g. it may be a third party mandated by the Data Owner to monetize this data).

**Data Curator**. An individual or organization that adds value to a dataset e.g. by assessing, labelling or enriching the data. Data auditors would fall in this category.

**Data Consumer**. An individual or organization making sense of datasets, e.g. by leveraging data science or AI techniques to create aggregated data (data outcomes) or simply consuming the data. Privacy-Preserving Compute: Making use of data without exposing data itself to the data Consumer, which means preserving the privacy of the data.

**Compute Outcomes.** Substrates of newly created data and datasets by applying Compute (algorithms) that do not allow to determine back the original data inputs, but are based on all of input data. These could be Compute outcomes like statistics, repotts, benchmarks and forecasts, but also more sophisticated outcomes like AI-trained neural networks.

**Datatokens**. Datatokens are a new asset class, technically they are fungible tokens that provide rights about datasets. These rights could be access rights or the right of participating in the monetization by the dataset. But these rights are not limited to that, especially based on the composability of Datatokens might also be used as a collateral for a loan, may be traded on exchanges or act as a right to vote in a DAO or other form of decision making or voting.
