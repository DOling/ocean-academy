### The only thing you need to connect to the blockchain world is a wallet.

Installing a wallet will create a new account for you, which is needed to transact on the blockchain. Each account is composed of a public address visible by anyone, and of a private key that controls the public address and the funds on the account.
 - **Your public address is like your bank account number**: you may give it to anyone to receive money on the account.
 - **Your private key can be thought of as your account's digital signature**: it is yours only as it grants authorization to make transactions from your account.

Anyone who has the private key can make transactions from the account, so it is important to keep your private key safe. Your account will allow you to buy and sell data, data assets, and services through the Ocean Protocol network.

Wallets come in many forms and flavors, but a popular option is MetaMask, simple browser add-on (and mobile app). It is quick to install, but it takes some planning: now is the time to get prepared to write down, backup, and carefully save your seed phrase and password.***The seed phrase of MetaMask must be kept secret and safe, it’s the unique key to your wallet.*** There is no other way to access your wallet than with this seed phrase and password, so you have to be extra careful if you don't want to lose access.

**Install MetaMask.**
On a laptop, it will get added as a browser extension, in the top right corner of your browser. Click on the fox icon and get started. You can decide to provide anonymized information to MetaMask or not.

**Create your Wallet.**
Provide a secure password to secure access to your wallet. Read the T&C and agree. Now MetaMask will generate a secret backup phrase for you. This is called a seed. A seed is a collection of random words (in MetaMask it’s 12 words) used as a unique starting point to create your accounts. Consider and treat it like a root password.

Although MetaMask provides an option to back-up your secret phrase later, it is strongly recommended that you do this immediately. This is the unique key to your wallet; if you lose it, you lose everything that is associated with it.

Feel free to [read more on public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and [how seed phrases are used to create addresses (with code in Python)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki ). It’s not needed here, but it’s interesting anyway.

Confirm your secret backup phrase and finish your MetaMask wallet setup.
