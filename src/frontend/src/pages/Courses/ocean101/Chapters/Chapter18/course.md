# Chapter 18: Ocean for Algorithm Providers

#### Difficulty: **3/5** \| Estimated reading time: **5 min**

<dialog character="mantaray">Not all fishes in the Ocean are capable of coding their own algorithms. That’s why they rely on Algorithm Providers.</dialog>

**Algorithms are considered as data assets, and are exchanged in the exact same way as datasets on Ocean Protocol**. By making their algorithms available, Algorithm Providers are paid every time one of their algorithms is used.

Algorithm Providers share their ML scripts with the market. Just like datasets, algorithms can be sold for download, or sold to be used on datasets offering compute power in addition to the data ([chapter 19](https://oceanacademy.io/ocean101/chapter-19) provides an overview, our [*Introduction to Compute-to-Data* course](https://oceanacademy.io/ComputeToData) provides a more in-depth look)

**Clear use cases**. Let’s say you are a coffee farmer in Nicaragua, and you want to sell roasted beans at the local market. The prices at the market are subject to sharp changes depending on numerous factors. But you need to sell at the best price to pay for expenses and develop your activity. Via Ocean Protocol, you can get the data you need (e.g. historical price data, global meteorological data, etc.) and use it in a pre-trained Deep learning model to get a price forecast for the next 3 months (the same kind used by hedge-funds). You have never seen any data nor any algorithm, but now you know when to sell your beans to maximize your revenue.

There is a clear need for a transparent and unified algorithm market.

**Ocean provides a mechanism for quality signaling for both data and algorithms** thanks to built-in financial incentives. Ocean token holders play the role of curators, as they can earn revenue by locking Ocean tokens into datasets and algorithms. They then earn every time the data or the algorithm is used, proportionally to the amount they lock (or stake, as we say in Web3).

Ocean token holders have a financial incentive to invest in the data sets that they think will be most used, and the total amount invested on a particular data asset provides a signal on its quality. Buyers of data and algorithms benefit from this market dynamic to judge the trustworthiness of an Ocean asset (more on this in our [*Intro to Data DeFi* course](https://oceanacademy.io/introToDataDefi)).
