# Chapter 10: Intro to Smart Contracts and Web3
#### Difficulty: **3/5** \| Estimated reading time: **10 min**

<dialog character="jellyfish">Have you heard about Smart Contracts and Web3? You don’t need to know the inner workings of how Smart Contracts work, but having a general idea of what they are and what they do will help. You may see in the water  without a mask, but things are blurry, so here is your next piece of equipment.</dialog>


**A Smart Contract is just a program that runs on a distributed computer.** It may involve one or more people and transactions.

A Smart Contract will automatically perform transactions based on predetermined conditions, exactly as coded. For example, a coin flip can easily be programmed in a Smart Contract: “If heads, you win our 5$ bet, if tails, I win the bet”. The program is run on the blockchain, which makes it a neutral ground for all parties involved, and it cannot be cheated.

Smart Contracts are especially useful for managing data workflows across people, teams, and companies, because they run in a way that is 100% deterministic. This means that once the Smart Contract is deployed, it will run exactly as agreed when the conditions are triggered.

**Smart Contracts as virtual vending machines**. A Smart Contract could make some data available under the precondition that a payment is received. Such Smart Contract will always deliver access to the data when it has received the required payment, anytime, to anyone. This can come handy in the case of  late night work on an analysis due in the morning. Just “pay and play”.

**Verifiability**. The agreement in the Smart Contract, its trigger conditions, and the operations it does are all publicly verifiable on the blockchain. In our previous example, everyone can track if and how the data was accessed and verify that the access condition was met. This is made simple thanks to blockchain technology: the blockchain stores all transaction(s) related to all Smart Contracts, providing cryptographic proof of everything that happened.

**Web3**. Web3 is a mesh network of blockchains and Smart Contracts that interact with each other, and that form a new network sitting on top of the current internet. Web3 is an awesome new space because it has no central point, no owners, and no borders.
It’s called Web3 because it’s an evolution of the internet since its beginning. The Web3 internet is built on fundamentally different infrastructure, relying on blockchains and distributed peer-to-peer networks, rather than on server-client relationships.

The Web 2.0  introduced the possibility for users to add their own content to blogs, profile pages and then to social networks. Central entities monetize user data to provide ‘free’ accounts and services on their platforms. This has evolved in what leading academics now describe as <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff/1127581387" target="_blank" >surveillance capitalism</a>.

**Web3 allows for full liberalization of networks**, removing the need for central intermediaries. Just like TCP/IP are communication protocols that define how information is sent between clients and servers over the internet, Ocean Protocol is a protocol that defines how data assets are exchanged over the decentralized Web.
