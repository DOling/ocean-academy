<dialog character="mantaray">Now that you have explored the depth of Ocean Protocol with your own eyes, what will you take away from the immersion? Here is a helper!</dialog>

We made a list of the *Top 5* takeaway.

1. **Web3 Value Exchange.** Blockchain and the Ethereum Virtual Machine have unlocked new ways to exchange value and data in the decentralized internet, the Web 3.0
2. **Data science to Web3.** Ocean Protocol provides the middleware to connect the work of data managers and scientists to the vigorous world of Web3
3. **Key Components.** Ocean Protocol toolbox components like metadata standards, compute-to-data capability, and marketplace reference implementation open up new paths for data orchestration and algorithm exchanges
4. **Data markets**. In data supply, Ocean Protocol allows anyone to monetize their data, which provides an incentive to share more data. At the heart of the market, data speculators provide data curation on Datatokens via price signaling. In data demand, AI and Data scientists get access to more data, curated on globally connected marketplaces
5. **New Data Economy**. With Ocean Protocol, data and AI workflows can be redesigned from scratch, in a 100% liberalized way, leading to cost savings and extra value creation thanks to better data models and AI. And a New Data Economy emerges.

Of course, there is much more to it, like how datatokens can be used in all the existing DeFi (Decentralized Finance) infrastructure on Ethereum, making advanced financial instruments available for use in data science and data valorization.
