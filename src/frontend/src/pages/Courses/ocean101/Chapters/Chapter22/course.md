<dialog character="mantaray">We’ve seen a lot of things in the depths of the Ocean. Let’s see how Ocean Protocol has been implemented to solve real problems above sea level.</dialog>

Ocean Protocol has already been tested and integrated by different companies across industries, from logistics to healthcare.

**Data infrastructure - GAIA-X**

**Gaia-X is a European project to design data infrastructure** for the next generation: a secure, federated system that meets the highest standards of digital sovereignty and promotes innovation. Gaia-X is the cradle of an open, transparent, decentralized digital ecosystem, where data sharing and monetization are possible without sacrificing data sovereignty, data protection, privacy, and European values.

Ocean Protocol offers a technical solution to serve as a basis for GAIA-X as it enables creating open, transparent, and decentralized data markets.
As data has the potential to become the single most valuable asset of our time, Gaia-X will significantly contribute to the economic welfare of all Europeans in the coming decades.

*“​​Ocean Protocol is working with Gaia-X to help deliver goals for the development of an efficient, competitive, secure and trustworthy federation of data infrastructure and service providers for Europe.”* — Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol founder.

Ocean Protocol provides core functionalities for the Gaia-X federated services. It enables services to interact with each other and be used like lego bricks to build new and more complex products.

**Automotive - Drive & Stake**

Over the past decades, vehicles have become mobile hubs of data, generating and processing vast volumes of information. The generated data is powering disruptive data-driven business models and services behind interconnected ride-sharing, car-sharing, and autonomous (self-driving) cars.

Drive&Stake promotes industry-wide data exchange and enables participants within the mobility ecosystem to obtain extensive insights through real-time data analytics.
Drive&Stake is powered by a decentralized, scalable end-to-end solution for the creation of automated mobility data marketplaces involving several partners.
RIDDLE&CODE, the leading European blockchain interface company, provides a flexible hardware stack and a software-driven approach that unlocks data in a secure, confidential manner and tokenizes the produced data by pegging it to real-life objects. Ocean Protocol allows the exchange and monetization of data and data-based services, overcoming the trade-off between the benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it.

Drive&Stake enables participants in the mobility ecosystem to share, access, and benefit from vehicle-generated data. It supports a variety of use cases, including pay-as-you-drive, networked parking for car-sharing, incentivized mobility patterns, sustainable EV battery, and supply-chain traceability. This is opening up the space for further use cases that haven’t been thought through yet, but that can be developed and implemented in the future.


**AI Engineering - DataUnion**

<img src="/images/chapter22_2.png" />

AI is constrained by data, both in quality and in quantity. Current data available to build AI is limited, full of biases, or simply not accessible. This is a real industry-wide problem.

Data unions effectively address this issue: the data from a single person is not very relevant for machine learning but the power is in the numbers - a million users can generate a relevant amount of data quickly.
Data unions pool data from participants together. The union owns, governs and monetizes the data asset created collectively. Individuals are incentivized to contribute as they can share the revenues from the union proportionally to their contribution to it.

DataUnion is the first ecosystem built on Ocean Protocol which enables anyone to create a data union. The DataUnion-as-a-service platform provides unique blockchain features for agile, collaborative AI development and gives every individual, professional, corporate, or governmental partner the opportunity to use their data for a better future and their own profit.

Individuals in the Image & Annotation Vault data union, for example, share pictures with annotations on objects to train better and more open object-recognition AI models. And they get rewarded for their contributions. The long term goal of this dataset is to contain billions of crowdsourced, verified and annotated images. To make the data AI ready it also has to be annotated (example: What is exact in this image? Where is it?) and this annotation has to be verified. DataUnion has built a system that enables this process to be crowdsourced.

It could legitimately envision becoming the most complete and diverse annotated image dataset, leading to superior object-recognition AI. And this is just one of the many data unions that have been created thanks to the platform; possibilities are endless.

On top of the data itself DataUnion establishes a layer of insights on the data and connects them to the data producers via a revenue share on the sales of the insights. This enables the value of the AI to be shared end-to-end, from the consumer to the producer of the data and everyone in between.
