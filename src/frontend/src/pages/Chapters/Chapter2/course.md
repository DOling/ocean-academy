# Chapter 2 : Why should you care?

By the end of the Ocean 101 Academy, you will have earned the ‘Envoy’ title in the Ocean Ambassadors community.

## But first things first, why should you care about Ocean Protocol?

You can look at the demand for data, or at the supply of data. Regardless of where you start there is a gap, because data supply and demand are currently not well connected.

Many data scientists are limited by their access to quality data to support decision making, build services or data products. And only they know how much data is needed to reach decent accuracy in data science, and particularly in AI.

Meanwhile, there is about 9’800 GB of data per person connected to the internet, most of which remains unused, or untouchable because data owners are afraid of losing exclusivity (i.e. data theft) or want to keep a dominant position to charge a premium for accessing the data.

Ocean Protocol is set to bridge the gap. An open data economy will open the data ap on data scientists so they can create breakthrough data products. And it can grant data owners a revenue for safely letting their data flow.

In fact Ocean Protocol is already being integrated by enterprises across verticals, from packaged goods sales data aggregation, freight & logistics collaboration, biotech research funding, and to data orchestration in the automobile industry.

Don’t worry about the blockchain stuff, it’s much easier than you think!
