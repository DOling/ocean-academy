# Chapter 21: Use cases by vertical

<dialog character="mantaray">We’ve seen a lot of things in the depths of the Ocean. Let’s see how Ocean Protocol has been implemented to solve real problems above sea level.</dialog>

Ocean Protocol has already been tested and integrated by different companies across different industries, from logistics to healthcare.

## HealthCare - RocheDiagnostic

Using Ocean Protocol, private medical real-time data can be transmitted, viewed, and shared from patients’ self-monitoring device to medical professionals and institutions. Patients get faster and better feedback because the tools have greater access to data from patients with chronic heart conditions.

The goal is to build subject-specific and generalized data models based on patient bio-medical and free-living sensor data. Ethical concerns and personal data protection laws prevent patient data from being copied and shared without considerable transformation of the data. This removes much of its value, and by extension the value of the models trained for health applications. **An Ocean Protocol powered data marketplace makes it easier** to connect the data suppliers and allow them to share their data safely while keeping exclusive control. This provides Ocean Protocol with an excellent use case for privacy-preserving computation (C2D).

## Logistics - dexFreight

dexFreight and Ocean Protocol are building a marketplace to allow logistics companies (freight brokers, shippers, carriers, and technology providers) to utilize their operational data. Not only to generate additional revenue and savings, but also to make the data available for the community to build better products and processes, and to minimize their environmental impact.

**Monetize data**. Actors in the logistics vertical have been reluctant to sell their data because of confidentiality issues. It’s also a fragmented industry where small companies had no way to monetize data due to a lack of technology, negotiation resources, and smaller individual data sets.

In the dexFreight omnichannel data marketplace, transportation and logistics companies can efficiently aggregate and securely sell their data using standardized templates in smart contracts. This provides an extra revenue stream for them, and pushes standardization in the industry, which can enhance collaboration opportunities.

**Improve operational efficiency.** As a blockchain-based platform, dexFreight has immediate access to end-to-end operations, shipment, and payment data from logistics and transportation companies. The data can be used to build optimization models and enable effective decision-making. For example, shipping companies need short-term price predictions for hundreds of origin-destination pairs to correctly price freight, which is subject to fuel cost fluctuations, tariffs, market conditions, and other factors. In the omnichannel data marketplace, dexFreight will use machine learning to build and update these models and enable transportation and logistics companies to lease data that can be turned into actionable intelligence.

**Facilitate industry wide improvement.** Creating a community repository of data will contribute to the good of the transportation and logistics industry by making aggregated and anonymous data publicly available for implementing operational best practices, forming industry-wide strategies, and supporting policy discussions. The new marketplace is federating a loose group into an industry force.

## Automotive - Daimler AG

Using Ocean Protocol solutions, Daimler is creating a decentralized sharing platform for its financial and sales data across several production hubs and regions and with some of its supply chain partners.

With this integration, Daimler aims to give worldwide access to data transparently and securely, streamline its operations further and extract crucial insights from some undiscovered datasets. Moreover, it also helps to maintain transparency and keep a check on who’s looking at what.
