# Chapter 7: New Data Workflows for Enterprises 

<dialog character="squid">Why are we doing all this, you may ask. Traditional data science workflows have been working fine for data scientists after all. Why transition to a new model? 
Let’s explore the benefits of a diverse and flourishing data underworld.

**Data as a liability.** Most companies consider data as an asset. But regulation is increasing the burden for companies to keep their data compliant. Processes, organization charts, and IT infrastructure are affected. For this reason some companies try to avoid any ‘personally identifiable’ data given the legal risk such data may represent. Sometimes, data cannot be shared even within the same company between teams because of regulations like GDPR.

**Data as a locked good.** In the legacy model, there is no easy way to give an algorithm access to one’s data without revealing the data itself. This creates loopholes in control and security (same problem of third party trust as for individuals). This explains why, despite many companies claim that data represents a competitive advantage, they prefer to keep it locked and unused. “Better safe than sorry”. Providing a way to share accesses to data easily and securely within and across organizations represents a major opportunity to create value from that data.

**Efficiency.** Finally, transacting on data and analytics has a cost, which can be reduced by using a unified technology stack. This results in better quality tools, service availability and an increased number of experts.

**Unlocking data with open infrastructure**. Ocean Protocol provides Web3 infrastructure dedicated to data management, which can be used by anyone - people and organizations - with full freedom. A common open infrastructure to safely and easily share data is a requirement to break data silos and create value. It makes new forms of collaborations possible, increases data sharing and data monetization, while cutting transaction costs down. Network effects of a liberalized data platform are expected to be huge.

**Monetizing Enterprise Data**. Enterprises can utilize this infrastructure to reorganize their data flows, start to safely monetize unused data,and find new monetization strategies. The first ones that will transition to this new model might have a decisive advantage over others in their respective markets. 

**Collaboration.** But it’s not just about trading data. The infrastructure enables collaboration on data creation, aggregation and governance. All of which without giving up control and ownership over company data. The potential for new insights, data products, workflows and business models is quite significant. 

**Community data.** Companies that heavily rely on the input of their users can further increase engagement with their community and provide them access to the data pool that was produced by them. This might lead to new forms of collectively owned datasets.
