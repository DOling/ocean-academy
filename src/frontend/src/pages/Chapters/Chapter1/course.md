# Chapter 1: Why should you Care?

<dialog character="squid">Are you ready to explore the ocean down to its depths? Dive and discover its surprising underworld. We’ll get to the bottom of it.</dialog>

Upon successful completion of the Ocean 101 Academy, participants get a certificate which marks their entry in the Ocean Ambassadors community, a group of leading AI/Web3 experts supporting the reshaping of the Data Economy.

**But first things first, why should you care about Ocean Protocol?**

Modern society runs on data. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) extracts value from data. More data means more accurate AI models, which in turn means more benefits to society and business. The greatest beneficiaries are companies that have both vast data and internal AI expertise, like Google and Facebook. In contrast, AI startups have amazing algorithms but are starving for data; and typical enterprises are drowning in data but have less AI expertise.

**Unfulfilled Data Demand.** Many data scientists are limited by their access to quality data to support decision making, build services, or data products. And only they know how much data is needed to reach decent accuracy in data science, and particularly in AI. In addition to the amount of data, data quality can also be a challenge when looking out for data.

**Anemic Data Supply.** There are about 9’800 GB of data per person connected to the internet, most of which remains unused, or untouchable because data owners don’t share it. Individuals may not share their data due to risks to their privacy or they are coerced to share their data only with the majors. And Corporations are reluctant to share or pool data with others by fear of losing exclusivity (i.e. data theft) and losing a competitive advantage.

**A New Data Economy with Ocean Protocol.** Ocean Protocol is set to bridge the gap between data supply and demand . An open data economy will open the data for scientists so they can create breakthrough data products. And it can grant data owners a revenue for safely letting their data flow.

**Pushing the Frontier.** Ocean Protocol is already being integrated by enterprises across verticals, from packaged goods sales data aggregation, freight and logistics collaboration, biotech research funding, and to data orchestration in the automobile industry.

**Don’t worry about the blockchain stuff, it’s much easier than you think!**
