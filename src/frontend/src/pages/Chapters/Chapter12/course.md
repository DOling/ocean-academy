# Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Data using Ocean Protocol

**Storing an immutable reference**. In the previous chapter we learned that it’s 1) too expensive to directly upload data to the Ethereum blockchain and 2) it disables us to have any kind of control regarding the access of the data. So why don’t we just save our data in a place where we can control access and provide a link to the data on the blockchain? We can easily modify the store() function to accept a link and additional metadata to describe the data. Everyone can find a link to our data and access it then. But how do we control access to the data? We would also need to manage payments, sign-ups, data access control, provide an interface, advertise our data so that someone can find it at all. And at this point, we should realize that we do not need any blockchain to do this. Since nothing is happening on the blockchain anyways.

**Automation**. But while we register for ten different marketplaces we realize that some of them want to charge us to register. Since every marketplace has additional costs to onboard someone. So you wonder if it would not be easier to have a central place to store information about your data so that the marketplaces crawl that place and we do not need to register in every place individually. Since none of the marketplaces wants to become dependent on a third party the only available solution is to have an independent smart contract where everyone can register their data. And now the blockchain part makes sense again.

**Introducing Ocean**. This is exactly what the protocol does. It implements standards on how to provide a valid link to the data, description, and further metadata. Now the marketplaces just crawl Ocean smart contracts to list available datasets. Additionally, it also takes care of payments. When someone buys the data from a data marketplace the marketplace would convert it into ETH (minus the marketplace fees) and send it directly to the user. Now if you want to buy a new dataset you could just visit your favorite data marketplace and see which dataset matches your needs. Once you are happy, you pay the given price and receive an access token to obtain the data.

Ocean Protocol provides a standard way to do all of this. Eventually, it increases the quality of data markets since they can focus their limited resources to provide additional features that might be useful for their users instead of reimplementing a payment process yet again.
