# Chapter 6: Data and Web3

<dialog character="jellyfish">The Web3 space extends the field of possibilities, and by now we start to meet funky new creatures in our diving descent.</dialog>

**Data value.** Data is often compared to oil, but the metaphor does not work. Oil is burnt to release energy and can be found in nature. But data does not get wasted when consumed. And data is produced by users and can only provide value when analyzed and aggregated with other data.

**Private data**. While we often think about data aggregated by big internet companies we forget about the potential of the unstructured and unshared data of individuals. Think about all those mobile phone users who have hundreds of pictures that could be used to train algorithms. Currently, this data cannot be monetized, but it would have value if it would be aggregated.

**Trust in third parties.** Selling personal private data nowadays requires to trust third parties to protect the data from abuse. Small companies may not have the will or the skills to secure data. Even big organizations have a history of data breaches, and cases of mishandling of user data are far too common, even today.

**User data ownership.** In the Web3 model, the control of the data is in the hand of the user. The data itself is not owned by the company providing a service anymore, only accessed. Users provide access to their data while keeping full ownership. This opens the opportunity for individuals to control and therefore monetize their data without worrying about losing ownership and while maintaining privacy. The data could be saved fully encrypted on the user's device or on a third-party server. Additionally, it gives individuals better visibility of how their data is accessed and used by analysts and companies.

**Incentivized data sharing**. Data control offers users much greater incentives to share their data: it’s safe, they can earn a revenue from their data, and decide exactly what data is shared, to whom, and how. It makes it difficult for companies to lock-in their users since the data is in the hands of the user. The user can switch to other services without losing any data, which might ultimately lead to more specialized tools and interfaces.

**Illustrating how it works with a Web3 chat app.** Suppose you saved your contact information (e.g. email, name, image, address, etc.) on your mobile phone. Now you want to use a chat app to interact with your friends. You download a chat app with the interface that you like the most and it asks to access additional information like your profile image. While these fields may be optional, they help to improve the user experience. The app provider only needs to ask for a unique ID and save it into its database. As long as the app follows open standards it is just a User Interface to enable chatting. Chatting can be done in a peer-to-peer way while all data is saved on the user's mobile phone. If you do not like the app you could easily switch to a new User Interface while keeping the data already provided in the previous app.

**Monetizing your private data**. Chat users can sell their chat data if they want to. Imagine a company that wants to analyze the most used words in private chats over time. Chat users could sell a wordlist and/or occurrences of words and earn money. So it’s not the chat app that has a monopoly over this data, but users, and this puts the chat app in competition with other analytics service providers. A clever chat app provider would offer their users a payment or other kinds of advantages if users allow them to analyze their chats.

In summary Web3 forces companies to offer these kinds of incentives, because there is finally an open market around user (produced) data.
