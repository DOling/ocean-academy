# Chapter 13: What is Ocean Protocol?

<dialog character="mantaray">It's an entire ecosystem that lies in the depths of the Ocean. It's dark and mystical, but the creatures here are warm and welcoming</dialog>

Ocean Protocol is a protocol that defines how communication between data providers and data consumers takes place in a decentralized way, either directly or via Apps, like marketplaces.

Ocean Protocol provides a complete toolbox for data scientists and developers to securely publish, exchange, and use data.

- It allows data providers to securely monetize their private data in full transparency while keeping full ownership.
- It allows data consumers to run compute algorithms on vetted data, which was previously not accessible (data not shared, no open marketplace to find the data, no process to judge data quality/relevance).

The Ocean Protocol toolbox offers:

1.**Tools and libraries.** Smart contracts, libraries, and software components to publish and consume data services, build marketplaces, and develop other apps to privately and securely publish, exchange, and consume data. The Compute-to-Data feature is a core component of secure data exchanges.

2.**Standards to interact with data.** Standardization of data-related assets definitions in Web3, and standardization of metadata. This is key to enable large scale collaboration and the creation of an open and effective data market.

  1.**Definitions** An asset is the representation of different types of resources in Ocean Protocol. Typically an asset could be one of the following asset types:
    -**Dataset.** An asset representing a dataset or data resource. It could be for example a CSV file or multiple JPG files.
    -**Algorithm.** An asset representing a piece of software. It could be a python script using TensorFlow, a spark job, etc.
  2.**Metadata** is stored in a blockchain context efficiently. Information encompasses the name of data asset, description, owner, price, and other details like category, tags, creation and update dates, etc. It can also provide a sample of the data.</li>

3.**Web3 access control.** Traditional access control uses centralized intermediaries, where data owners risk losing control of their data. Ocean Protocol restores control and privacy by replacing the centralized intermediaries with a decentralized blockchain network. Web3 provides a seamless experience across services using the same key, their Ethereum wallet (e.g. MetaMask).

Ocean Protocol technology stack provides high-level functionalities to facilitate data exchanges for users in an easy way:

-**Publishing** - Allows the user to publish new assets to the network.
-**Consuming** - Allows the user to list and consume published assets. 
-**Marketplace** - Enables complex interactions and advanced capabilities.
